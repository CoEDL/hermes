## Creating Resources from an ELAN (*.eaf) File
1. Launch Hermes and select the 'Import ELAN File' mode button.
2. Click the 'Load' button and use the file window that opens to select the 
ELAN file you would like to create resources from.
3. Hermes will automatically parse the ELAN file and provide you with a selection
of tiers from which to choose your transcription and translation tiers. When you
are satisfied with your selection, click the import button.
4. A table will appear, populated with the transcriptions, translations and buttons
for previewing audio.
    - If you would like re-record audio for any transcription, right-click the preview
    button for that line, a recording window will appear. You can change the recording
    microphone in the Settings/Preferences Menu (⌘ + B).
    - If you would like to associate an image with a transcription, left-click the image
    icon.
5. Click the 'Include' checkbox for any transcriptions you would like to include in the
exported resources. You can also click the 'Select All' button.
6. When you have selected all of the transcriptions you require, click the 'Choose' button
to select an output location.
7. Once you have selected a valid output location an export button should appear. Click it
to begin the export process.
    -  If you want to change the output format (OPIE, JSON, CSV), you may do so in the
    Settings/Preferences menu, which is accessible from the toolbar or via (⌘ + B).
    
### Note: Installing the FFMPEG Plugin
- By default, Hermes only includes support for WAV audio.
If you need to work with other formats, please install the FFMPEG plugin
in the settings menu.
